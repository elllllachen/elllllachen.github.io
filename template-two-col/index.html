          -- Banana Oat Baked French Toast --
          <br><br>
          This single serve baked French toast is spiked with the delicious combination of bananas and oats! It’s vegan, refined sugar free, easily made gluten-free, and packed with fiber and plant-based protein. A healthy and delicious breakfast!

          This bake straight up tastes like banana bread. Seriously. Banana bread or a banana nut butter sandwich. French toast is generally made with eggs, but he eggy taste to be a little overpowering, so swapped it out with half a banana and definitely like that version a lot more. It also means that this bake is vegan and safe for people with egg allergies. Hooray!

          It’s also single-serve (meaning it’s all for YOU), loaded with fiber and plant-based protein, free of refined sugars, and a pretty amazing way to start the day. Oh, and delicious. Definitely delicious…

          -- Mediterranean Grilled Cheese Sandwich --
          <br><br>
          If you love mediterranean flavors, you’ll die over this mediterranean grilled cheese sandwich. It’s such a fun way to switch up your sandwich game and it’s loaded with VEGGIES and yes cheese too, but VEGGIES which basically makes it healthy.

          · Cheesy <br>
          · Healthy <br> 
          · Still considered comfort food <br>

          · Veggie-filled <br>
          · Simple <br>

          <br><br>
          INSTRUCTIONS
          <br><br>
          1) Put all of the ingredients for the pancakes in a blender and blend until smooth!
          <br><br>
          2) Meanwhile, heat a nonstick griddle (or large nonstick skillet) coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Spoon 1/2 of the batter (if making 2 large pancakes) OR 1/4 of the batter (if making 4 smaller pancakes) onto pre-heated griddle. Turn pancakes over when tops are covered with bubbles and edges look cooked. Remove from griddle when both sides are cooked, and place pancakes on a serving plate.
          <br><br>
          3) To make the filling, simply mix Greek yogurt (or cottage cheese puree) with jam (or diced/crushed strawberries) and sweetener in a small bowl. Divide filling between pancakes, and roll pancakes up around filling. Place roll-ups on plate seam-side down so they stay rolled, or secure with a toothpick! Serve with strawberries, low sugar jam, or low sugar maple syrup if desired! Enjoy!
