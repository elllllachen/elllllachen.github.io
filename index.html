            Publishing is going through another major shiftâ€”from the focus of large-scale, big budget publishing to the small-scale independent press. There is an obvious shift away from the economic dependency of scale and expensive mass marketing. To a reliance of digital production, digital content and digital authorship. We have now arrived at individualised publishing often virtually consumed by an international network of peers.
            <br><br>
            This unit will reclaim the subversive, the radical and the internet. It will require you to consider the influence of media and technology on our lives, as well as how publishing adapts to a new pace and continuous change. It considers the relationship between print and digital layout processes and will explore methods of design thinking for digital publishing, through the use of technology.
